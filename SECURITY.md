# Security Policy - Forgot Password Worker

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and vulnerability management for the Forgot Password Worker. This worker handles sensitive password reset operations and requires robust security measures.

## Security Features

### Email Validation & Protection
- **Email Format Validation**: All email addresses are validated for proper format
- **Domain Validation**: Email domains are checked for validity
- **Enumeration Prevention**: Response times are consistent regardless of email existence
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-email rate limiting prevents abuse

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Request Validation**: All incoming requests are validated for proper format
- **Email Sanitization**: Email inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Content-Type Enforcement**: Only application/json content type is accepted
- **Method Restriction**: Only POST HTTP method is allowed

### Backend Security
- **Secure Communication**: All backend API calls use HTTPS
- **API Authentication**: Backend requests include proper authentication headers
- **Timeout Protection**: Network timeouts prevent hanging connections
- **Error Handling**: Backend errors are handled securely

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
- **IP-Based Limiting**: Maximum 5 requests per IP per hour
- **Email-Based Limiting**: Maximum 3 requests per email per day
- **Distributed Protection**: Rate limiting works across multiple worker instances
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired rate limit data is automatically removed

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats
1. **Password Reset Abuse**: Automated systems flooding password reset requests
2. **Email Enumeration**: Attempts to discover valid email addresses
3. **Injection Attacks**: Email injection or other input-based attacks
4. **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data exposure through error messages
5. **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Attempts to overwhelm the system

### Mitigations
1. **Comprehensive Rate Limiting**: Multiple layers of protection
2. **Consistent Responses**: Same response time/format regardless of email validity
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all inputs
4. **Error Sanitization**: Generic error messages without sensitive information
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events

## Security Configurations

### Environment Variables
```
BACKEND_URL - Backend API endpoint (configured as secret)
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY - Email service authentication (optional)
EMAIL_SERVICE_URL - Email service endpoint (optional)
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- Per-IP: 5 requests per hour
- Per-Email: 3 requests per day
- Configurable via environment variables
- KV storage for persistent rate limiting

## Incident Response

### Security Event Monitoring
- Excessive password reset requests
- Invalid email format attempts
- Backend integration failures
- Rate limiting violations

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Identify and contain the threat
2. **Analysis**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Mitigation**: Implement fixes and enhanced protections
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Documentation**: Record incident details and lessons learned
