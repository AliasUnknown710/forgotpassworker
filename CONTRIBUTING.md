- **New features** - Add new capabilities
- **Documentation improvements** - Enhance guides and examples
- **Performance optimizations** - Make the worker faster and more efficient
- **Security improvements** - Strengthen security measures

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for similar issues or feature requests
2. **Create an issue** - Discuss significant changes before implementing
3. **Assign yourself** - Let others know you're working on something
4. **Follow conventions** - Use existing code style and patterns

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **JavaScript**: Follow modern ES6+ conventions
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Linting**: Use ESLint to catch potential issues
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic

### Coding Standards

#### JavaScript Best Practices

```javascript
// Use async/await for asynchronous operations
async function handleRequest(request, env) {
  try {
    const data = await request.json();
    // Process data
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors appropriately
  }
}

// Use descriptive variable names
const userEmail = request.email;
const resetToken = generateSecureToken();

// Implement proper error handling
if (!isValidEmail(userEmail)) {
  return new Response('Invalid email format', { status: 400 });
}
```

#### Security Considerations

- Never log sensitive information
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper CORS headers
- Add rate limiting for production use

#### Performance Guidelines

- Minimize external API calls
- Use appropriate response caching
- Optimize for cold start performance
- Handle timeouts gracefully
