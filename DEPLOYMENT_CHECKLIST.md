## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Pre-deployment Verification

```bash
# Verify configuration
wrangler whoami
wrangler secret list
wrangler kv:namespace list  # if using KV

# Test locally one more time
npm run dev
# Test with test.html or curl
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
wrangler deploy --env staging

# Test staging deployment
curl -X POST https://your-worker-staging.workers.dev \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@yourdomain.com"}'
```

### 3. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production

# Verify deployment
wrangler tail --env production  # Monitor logs
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Worker responds correctly to valid requests
- [ ] Worker returns appropriate errors for invalid requests
- [ ] Email sending functionality works end-to-end

- [ ] Memory usage reviewed and optimized
- [ ] External API call timeouts configured
- [ ] Response caching implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Bundle size minimized

### ✅ Scalability
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for expected load
- [ ] Database connection limits understood
- [ ] Email service rate limits planned for
- [ ] Auto-scaling considerations reviewed

## Security Hardening

### ✅ Production Security
- [ ] Remove development/debug code
- [ ] Implement proper HTTPS-only policies
- [ ] Configure secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Review and test CORS configuration
- [ ] Implement request size limits
- [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting if needed

### ✅ Data Protection
- [ ] Ensure no PII is logged unnecessarily
- [ ] Implement proper data retention policies
- [ ] Verify GDPR/CCPA compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Document data processing procedures

## Documentation Updates

### ✅ Documentation
